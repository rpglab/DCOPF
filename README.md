# DCOPF
DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF): (i) one lossless DCOPF model and (ii) two lossy DCOPF models.

This set of AMPL codes implements a regular lossless DCOPF model and two lossy DCOPF model. The test case used here is a standard IEEE 73-bus system; but these codes can work on any other systems.

Model 1 (M1) for lossy DCOPF:
# implemented the model (2)-(14) of the following paper: O. W. Akinbode and K. W. Hedman "Fictitious losses in the DCOPF with a piecewise linear approximation of losses," IEEE PES General Meeting, Jul. 2013.

Model 2 (M2) for lossy DCOPF:
# Iterative Loss Approximation based model
# Each iteration: calc total losses and then the change in loss than previous iteration, and then assign the losses to all/selected buses with same/different participation factors.
# This method converges when the difference of total losses between two consecutive iterations is less than a threshold.
# Possibly, two iterations repeat themselves, which cause method to diverge.
